# Statistical_Significance
> Statistical significance is a concept in statistics used to determine whether the results of an analysis or experiment are unlikely to have occurred by chance. It helps researchers decide if there is enough evidence to support a hypothesis or if observed differences or relationships are meaningful.

## Explaining with Coin
Explaining Statistical Significance with a Fair Coin (𝐻0) and Unfair Coin (𝐻1) Concept
> Imagine you are conducting an experiment to determine whether a coin is fair (has an equal chance of landing heads or tails). Here's how the null and alternative hypotheses work in this scenario:
> Hypotheses:
> + Null Hypothesis (𝐻0): The coin is fair. Probability of heads (𝑃(𝐻)) = 0.5.
> + Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻1): The coin is not fair. Probability of heads (𝑃(𝐻)) ≠ 0.5.

## Key Notes:
+ Null Hypothesis (𝐻0): Assumes no effect or no difference (e.g., the coin is fair).

+ Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻1): Suggests a deviation from the null (e.g., the coin is unfair).

+ Statistical Test: Determines if observed results (e.g., 60 heads in 100 tosses) are significantly different from expected results under 𝐻0

+ P-Value: Quantifies the likelihood of observing the data if 𝐻0 is true.

+ Decision: Compare p-value to 𝛼 to accept or reject 𝐻0​

_This process demonstrates the concept of statistical significance in testing whether a coin is fair._
